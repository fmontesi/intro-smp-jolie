## How to use this

First, clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/fmontesi/intro-smp-jolie`

Then, you can either:
- (Recommended) Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as follows.
	* Make sure that you have support for devcontainers enabled (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
	* Open the directory `intro-smp-jolie` with VS Code.
	* Click "Reopen in Container" when VS Code asks you.
	* VS Code will now create a development environment (a devcontainer) for you, with all the software needed to code and run the examples (including Jolie itself). This might take some time to prepare the first time around.
- [Install Jolie manually](https://www.jolie-lang.org/downloads.html) and use it to run the examples from your own terminal.
